<p>After a few weeks of &ldquo;papierkrieg&rdquo; we finally started into a <a href="https://prototypefund.de/">prototype fund</a> funded 6 months of HubGrep development!</p>
<p>This is the first post in a series of status update posts,
published (hopefully before) every second monday.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-have-done">what we have done</h2>
<h3 id="organisation">organisation</h3>
<p>A big part of this first week was actually getting an overview
of what we need to do over the next months, so we made ourselves some trello / kanban boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>One board for long-term tech planning.<br>
Basically it is a backlog for our <a href="/posts/2021-03-07_milestones/#milestones">milestones</a> below,
with one column per milestone, and an extra column for nice-to-have-but-out-of-scope stuff.</li>
<li>A separate board for the current milestone<br>
(will be a new board for the next one),
with a backlog, a &ldquo;doing&rdquo; column and a &ldquo;done&rdquo; column for each week.</li>
<li>And an extra non-tech board for organization stuff,<br>
with, for example,
a recurring ticket that reminds us to write these blog posts :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we set up a small low-tech nerd time tracking: text files in a git repository. :)</p>
<p>Also, since there was a lot of paper involved until the funding started,
we made ourselves a little document management system:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/puhoy/b25c17ea98fba9d5daf4ef4b74d88d6d">a small bash script</a> which runs ocr on our scanned pdfs,
making them searchable with a tool like <a href="https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all">ripgrep-all</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tech">tech</h3>
<p>We already started to make a small frame for a flask application, wrapping our cli search tool in a web service.
Now we added a first real HTML version to it, and startet a general development setup.</p>
<p>A sneak peek on our first attempt to a frontend:
<img src="/static/2021/hubgrep_20210305.png" alt="hubgrep sneak peek"></p>
<h2 id="what-we-are-doing">what we are doing</h2>
<p>I hope most of what involves sending physical paper around is over now and we can focus on acual programming.</p>
<p>That said, we are in the middle of our first milestone, setting up parts of our dev environment,
and adding basic functionality to the service.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">challenges</h2>
<p>I want to complain about the paperwork, needed to get the funding, once more. :)<br>
I have a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; job next to this, and i found this really exhausting to manage.
I tend to have all of this stuff in the back of my head until its finished (even if i write down what i have to), and thinking about it all the time really sucks.
If i did not have friends who are familiar with that kind of stuff, i would probably have been pretty lost in all this. (Thank you, Carolin. :) )</p>
<p>&hellip;But i guess i just hate all those formalities.</p>
